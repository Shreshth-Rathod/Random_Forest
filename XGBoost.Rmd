## Loading the required packages

require(ranger)
require(usemodels)
require(keras)
require(xgboost)
require(doParallel)
```


## Importing the data from kaggle as train and test dataset
```{r}
rest_rev=read.csv('/Users/shreshthrathod/Downloads/restaurant-revenue-prediction-2/train.csv')
rest_revTest = read.csv('/Users/shreshthrathod/Downloads/test.csv')
```


# Analyzing the data
```{r}
# Training data
sumType = rest_rev %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarise(summation = n())
ggplot(sumType, aes(x = Type, y = summation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")


# Test data
sumType = rest_revTest %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarise(summation = n())
ggplot(sumType, aes(x = Type, y = summation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")

rm(sumType)

# For training data there are only three categories but in the testing data there are four categories ('MB' is the extra categorical variable) which should not be the case as the predictors can't predict on a new unknown category. Hence, we should impute it to 'DT' as 'MB' is more related to drive thru than 'FC' or 'IL'.









# Training data
sum_CityGroup = rest_rev %>% group_by(City.Group) %>% summarise(summation = n())
ggplot(sum_CityGroup, aes(x = City.Group, y = summation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")


# Test data
sum_CityGroup = rest_revTest %>% group_by(City.Group) %>% summarise(summation = n())
ggplot(sum_CityGroup, aes(x = City.Group, y = summation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")

rm(sum_CityGroup)

# There's not much of a difference in the training and test set so no changes are required for this column









# Training data
sum_City = rest_rev %>% group_by(City) %>% summarise(summation = n())
ggplot(sum_City, aes(x = City, y = summation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
# sum_City %>% View()

# Test data
sum_City = rest_revTest %>% group_by(City) %>% summarise(summation = n())
ggplot(sum_City, aes(x = City, y = summation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
# sum_City %>% View()
rm(sum_City)

# In training data set, number of cities are less than the testing set and it won't do any good if we predict on new cities so it is better to drop the city column as we have the geo-location information in the P variables.









ggplot(rest_rev, aes(x= revenue)) + geom_boxplot()

# There are outliers which can affect the overall results during the model building
```


## Preprocessing the training(and validation) and testing data
```{r}
# Removing the outliers in order to get unbiased and better results

# Whether it is a 'DT' or 'MB' type restaurant, it can be assumed as an Inline restaurant as they all are one and the same and imputing them to a majority category would a good option for better understanding as well as would have a proportionate data distribution

rest_rev$Type[rest_rev$Type == 'DT'] = 'IL'

# For testing data
